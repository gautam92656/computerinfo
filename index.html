                    A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of
                    arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform
                    generic
                    sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of
                    tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating system
                    (main
                    software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation. This term may also
                    refer
                    to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or
                    computer cluster.

                    <p class="sum1">Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element,
                        typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, along with some
                        type
                        of computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out
                        arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of
                        operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices include input devices
                        (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and
                        input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen).
                        Peripheral
                        devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result
                        of
                        operations to be saved and retrieved.

                    A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple
                    special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory
                    devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices
                    like
                    personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which
                    links
                    billions of other computers and users.

                    Why is the page protected?
                    While most articles can be edited by anyone, semi-protection is sometimes necessary to prevent
                    vandalism to popular pages.
                    The reason for protection can be found in the protection log. If there are no relevant entries
                    in
                    the protection log, the page may have been moved after being protected.
